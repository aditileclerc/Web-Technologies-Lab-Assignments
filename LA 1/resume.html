        <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
        <h2>Basement Flood Alert System — January 2023 - Present</h2>
        <p>Built a Flood Alarm System using Raspberry Pi that goes off as an alert signal generator as part of a Design Thinking Project. The purpose was to prevent loss of property during floods for residents in low lying areas, by alerting them when water levels started to rise beyond a fixed level.</p>
        
        <h2>Smart Electricity Energy Meter— August 2021 - December 2021</h2>
        <p>Built a WiFi-enabled Smart Electricity Energy Meter using Arduino. One of the key problems of the existing energy meter system is that there is no full duplex communication. To solve this problem, we used a working example based on the Internet of Things (loT) to build this smart energy meter. Energy analysis by the consumer becomes much easier and controllable.</p>

        <h2>Personal Assistant System— August 2020 - March 2021</h2>
        <p>Built an interactive Personal Assistant System using Python and Python GUI
            (tkinter) as a group project. Project acts as a multipurpose app with several
            functions such as notes, internet search, memos and more</p>
